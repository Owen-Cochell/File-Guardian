# File-Guardian
File Guardian is a simple script(batch file), that allows end-users to create and modify hidden directories. 
Any type of file can be stored in this directory.
# Disclaimer
This script is for WINDOWS MACHINES ONLY! This script uses the 'attrib' command, which is only available on machines running Microsoft windows. For this reason, devices running any version of MacOS, linux, ect.. will not be able to run this file.
This script is not using any propriatary methods of hiding files, nor dose it use encryption of any kind. As stated above, this script uses system commands to lock/unlock files, and in that way, hidden files can be broken into if users know what they are doing. There are ways to secure hidden files, as described !here!
