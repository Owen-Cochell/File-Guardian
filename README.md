# File-Guardian
File Guardian is a simple script(batch file), that allows end-users to create and modify hidden directories. 
Any type of file can be stored in this directory.
# Disclaimer
This script is for WINDOWS MACHINES ONLY! This script uses the 'attrib' command, which is only available on machines running Microsoft windows. For this reason, devices running any version of MacOS, linux, ect.. will not be able to run this file.
This script is not using any propriatary methods of hiding files, nor dose it use encryption of any kind. As stated above, this script uses system commands to lock/unlock files, and in that way, hidden files can be broken into if users know what they are doing. There are ways to secure hidden files, as described [here](https://github.com/Owen-Cochell/File-Guardian/wiki/Securing-File-Guardian). Again, this script is for stopping average users who don't know what they are doing, not for securing sensitive data, as a semi-compitent user would be able to crack this script very easily.
# Downloading
Just download and go! File Guardian is a batch file in its basic state(for editing puropses by end-users), so it may be flagged by your anti-virus, or be blocked by Windows smartscreen. You may have to do some finagling and make some exceptions in your anti-virus. You may also have to make your computer "trust" Flile Guardian. This can be doen by right clicking, on File guardian, selecting Properties, and selecting "Trust this file" at the very bottom of the Genral tab.
# Usage 
Double-click on File Guardian to run it. Right click on File Guardian and select "edit" to edit it. Should be very simple.
I recommend checking out the code to File Guardian, as some things need to be defined(Like name of user, name of file, password, ect). Reading the commets should be helpful here.
# Conclusion
This script will stop most users from accessing your personal files, and with the right configurations, this script can be relatively secure. If you have any comments or bugs to report, please start a issue explicitly stating what your comment or bug is in the title. Thank you!
